# # import all | none | filter name | filter { filter commands } | where boolean filter expression
# # Specify a filter to be used for filtering routes coming from the protocol to the routing table. all is for keeping all routes, none is for dropping all routes. Default: all (except for EBGP).


# # export [ in prefix ] filter
# # This is similar to the import keyword, except that it works in the direction from the routing table to the protocol. If in keyword is used, only routes inside the given prefix are exported. Other routes are completely ignored (e.g. no logging and no statistics). Default: none (except for EBGP and L3VPN).
